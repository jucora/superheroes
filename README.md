## :pencil: Main Description

This project consists of the implementation of the fundamental concepts of the ReactJS library, as well as the use of Redux to manage the application state in an orderly manner and based on a single state throughout the application.

In order to offer persistence in the data, I decided to join Redux with LocalStorage, so that each change made in the Redux Store is automatically saved in the user's LocalStorage, in this way it is possible to refresh the browser and the information will remain available.

I want to give my thanks to Superhero API since it is an excellent API with which I have been able to carry out this project.

The Superhero API, is a quantified and programatically accessible data source of all superheroes from both the comic universe. We've taken all the stuff and put it together in a form that is easier to consume with software. Then we made an API so you can consume it in a hassle free manner.
